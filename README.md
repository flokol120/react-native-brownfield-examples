# React Native Brownfield Examples

This repository contains examples for brownfielding existing iOS and Android apps using React Native. The examples are divided by topics and can be found in separate branches. These branches were created based on the chapters of my bachelor thesis.

The main branch contains example iOS and Android applications in which React Native will be integrated in specific branches. Besides the integration of React Native in existing apps some branches include native modules, native components, Turbo Native Modules and Event Emitter.

## Native Logging Module

This branch contains a native module which will log a message to the native app using a title and a description. The implementation can be found within the folder `NativeLoggingModule`.
